DCPY

Utilities for working with DCPU-16 source and executables (see 0x10c.com for the spec, or find it in this repo).
Written in a LISP-ish impurely functional mode of Python.

PROJECT STATUS:

assembler.py [asm] [exe] - assembles a given source file
disassembler.py [exe] - prints a disassembled (textual) version of an executable

Emulator soon to come.
